			<P class="donate">Looking for a way to impactfully help our rescue? We are excited to offer you the opportunity to sponsor an animal that finds sanctuary here.
			So, what exactly does that mean? <br>
			
			Maybe you've wanted an exotic animal in your life, but aren't legally able to house one right now, don't feel prepared for the care that comes with one, or, have realized that they don't make great traditional pets. <br>

			Maybe you just love our mission here at Arctic Fox Daily and want to support us in a quiet - yet very important - way. <br>

			Well, this a unique opportunity for you to be invested in an individual fox or wolfdog's life, and to know that you're making a difference!
			</P>
		</div>
		
		<div class="how">
			
			<h2>How exactly does my donation help?</h2>
			
			<p>Your sponsor donation helps cover some of the costs of basic necessities for these animals. We have routine expenses for that include a varied diet, monthly internal and external parasite prevention, bedding and cleaning supplies, enrichment supplies, and more. If we have a month where we receive extra donations, we set aside funds in our savings account, to be used for medical emergencies.<br>

			In short, you help us give these animals the best lives possible!</p>

		<div class="what">
			<h2>What exactly does sponsorship entail?</h2>
			
			
			
			<p  class="exactly">&#x2022; A resident animal will only have one primary sponsor. They may have up to three co sponsors.<br>

			&#x2022; We ask that you please commit to our 6-month term of sponsorship.<br>

			&#x2022; Sponsorship donations will be due between the 1st and 5th of each month, and need to be set up as recurring, monthly donations through our PayPal. (Once you submit the form below, we will send you an email once there is an open spot to sponsor your desired resident, and a link to set up the recurring donation.)</p>
